# Usage
Hit `M-x` RET `org-easy-img-insert`. Issuing this will open up a mini buffer prompting you for the image link, image name, and an optional caption. The rest is taken care of by the package.

# Installation
Installation can be done through `MELPA`. Hit `M-x package-install` RET org-easy-img-insert. Then paste this to your `.emacs` or start up script.

```
(autoload 'org-easy-img-insert "org-easy-img-insert" "Launch org-easy-img-insert with  org-mode" t)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-easy-img-insert 1)))
```

If you are using spacemacs then you would need to add org-easy-img-insert to your additional packages, and the above code to your `dotspacemacs/user-init` function.

# How it works?
* The package will first create a `Resources` directory at the current location of the currently opened file.
* Then it will create a subdirectory within the `Resources` directory with the name of the currently opened file (for example, if the currently opened file is `test.org`, the package will create a subdirectory `test` within the Resources directory).
* Lastly, the package will download the image to the subdirectory, with the image name that you specified in the mini buffer.

# Contributing
Feel free to fork this package, and submit pull requests. Comments with sugesstions are appreciated, but I'd appreciate code more.

# Upcoming Features
* Inserting image directly from the clipboard
* Ability to change the directory that the package downloads the image to.
